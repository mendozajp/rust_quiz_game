Been a while. First deliverable has been reached. Instead of going to phase 2, I wanna do some refactoring and clean up. And since we need to get the rust cert for work, we'll need to plan ahead based on time. 
The following should be completed before moving on to phase 2:
- Make an enum for game state. Something like a conduct quiz and main menu. Probably have story and save and quit there too. 
- Make a save state for conduct quiz state.
- Refactor current functions.
- Make enum for result publisher. (make a big list of comments for fun)
- Remake quiz structures. Look for examples online. 
- Write unit tests when all above are completed. 

* Note that I know we didnt get the final note on completion of quiz, but its really not that important.

We started before this data but this is when I made the read me so whatever.

First objective. Get the logic side workining. I think first iteration can look like the following workflow:
 - Start Quiz Show script
 - Immediate prompt to type name of quiz you would like to do. 
    - Should be a list of all the known quizes in the proper folder
 - Upon typing the name, the quiz should immediatly restart, stdout will simply display the following:
    - Name of Quiz
    - Question
    - 4 Possible answers labeled 1-4
    - Prompt for user to enter a number from 1-4 for the desired answer. 

 - Upon completion of quiz, the results of the quiz should be displayed in said form:
    - Name of Quiz
    - Number of questions correct out of total number of questions incorrect
    - Modivational blurb depending on how well you did.
    - Prompt for user to end program or return to starting screen. 


I think this working is somewhat exceptable as a flashcard game. But not as a quiz show. But getting this much done is huge. 
After that, I think we go crazy on ui, keep all that functionality but get it working in like a window or something. make it look nice, make everything controllable with arrow keys, stuff like that. 
We can go into more details for the requirements on that front later. 
After this point it should look pretty nice, but it wont be anything more then a cool flashcard quiz setup until the last part is completed.
*Note to self - flashcard option where either you make your own notes or can just study the contents of a quiz would actually be pretty cool. But thats  future post submition work. Plenty of work to be done before then. 

Then the final objective, and what upon completion would constitue the game as being completed, would be the actual 
quiz show format, were you get a collection of a couple of quizes, and play against some bots. 

I think each task is pretty large but each are pretty similar is level of workload. 
On workdays lets update our progress here and see how we do. 







single examination template:
quiz_name = ""
[questions]
    [questions.question1]
    question = ""
    answer1 = ""
    answer2 = ""
    answer3 = ""
    answer4 = ""
    correct_answer = 0
