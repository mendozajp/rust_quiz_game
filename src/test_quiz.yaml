# # Coulpe of questions here:
# 1. Do we need the Question number? maybe for indexing and referencing? but we dont really want people looking at the yaml
# file, since it would be cheating. I guess it doesnt really matter? 
# 2. Quiz Metadata I think for now is out of scope. But thinking ahead, do we want to be reading that from here?
#   What if we let the user write notes for the question as a sort of hint for themselves? 
#   That gave me a seperate thought, what if we give each yaml file answer an optional metadata section 
#   for explinations on why thats the right answer or any other relevent infomation. That wouldnt normally be present
#   to the user but it might be displayed after either the correct or wrong answer is chosen.
